# Pizza Sales SQL Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a set of **SQL queries** for analyzing pizza sales data, as detailed in the document [`PIZZA_SALES_SQL_QUERIES.docx`](PIZZA_SALES_SQL_QUERIES.docx). The queries calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) and provide insights into:

- Sales trends over time
- Pizza categories and sizes
- Top- and bottom-performing pizzas
- Revenue distribution and customer preferences

The analysis is designed to help understand **sales patterns** and **business performance** for a pizza business.

The queries are written for a SQL database containing a `pizza_sales` table with columns such as:

- `order_id`  
- `order_date`  
- `pizza_name`  
- `pizza_category`  
- `pizza_size`  
- `quantity`  
- `total_price`
