Pizza Sales SQL Analysis

Overview

This repository contains a set of SQL queries for analyzing pizza sales data, as detailed in the document PIZZA SALES SQL QUERIES.docx. The queries calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) and provide insights into sales trends, pizza categories, sizes, and top/bottom-performing pizzas. The analysis is designed to help understand sales patterns, revenue distribution, and customer preferences for a pizza business.

The queries are written for a SQL database containing a pizza_sales table with columns such as order_id, order_date, pizza_name, pizza_category, pizza_size, quantity, and total_price.
